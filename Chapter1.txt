GIVING COMPUTERS THE ABILITY TO LEARN FROM DATA

We will cover the following topics here in this chapter:-
1. The general concept of machine learning
2. The three types of learning and basic technology
3. The building blocks for successfully designing machine learning systems

Data can be in two forms:-
1. Strucutre data, or we can say data in tabular form or better organize data
2. Unstructured data, as name implies data which is not structured or organized

Machine learning is the subfield of Artificial Intelligence, artificial intelligence comprises of the algorithm that derived knowledge from data in order to make predictions.

THREE DIFFERENT TYPES OF MACHINE LEARNING
1. SUPERVISED LEARNING (Labeled data, Direct Feedback, Predict outcome/future)
2. UNSUPERVISED LEARNING (No label data, No feedback, Find hidden structure in data)
3. REINFORCEMENT LEARNING (Decision process, Reward System, Learn series of actions)

#PREPROCESSING IMPORTANT POINTS
----------------------------------------------
Many machine learning algorithms also require that the selected features are on the same scale for optimal performace, which is often achieved by transforming the feature in the range [0,1] or a standard normal distribution with zero mean and unit variance.

Some of the selected features may be highly correlated and therefore redundant to a certain degree, in this cases, dimensionality reduction techniques are useful for compressing the feature onto a lower dimensional subspace.

In some cases when data contains high amount of noise, dimensionality reduction technique can be used to improve the predictive model.

We will make frequent use of hyperparameter optimization techniques that help us to fine-tune the performace of our model, hyper parameters are parameters that are not learned from the data but represent the knobs of a model that we can turn to improve its performace.
